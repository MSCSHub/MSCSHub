This course map will need to be updated periodically by the community to include new courses and changes in classification or pre-requisites.

The diagram was created using the free website draw.io. 

You can update it by visiting draw.io, select Device > Open Existing Diagram. Save the new file in the same folder and name it "UT MSCSO Course Relations.png".
