The Hub is a website that allows students in UT's MSCS and MSDS to review courses and connect to student-run communities.

Computer Science - [MSCSHub.com](https://mscshub.com)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data Science - [MSDSHub.com](https://msdshub.com)

Each website is tailored to the indivual program but is all run using the same frontend and backend codebase. The entire frontend is built using Angular v11. The backend is serverless and runs off of firebase with node.js functions.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
<!--- These are just example requirements. Add, duplicate or remove as required --->
* You have installed the latest version of `Node.js`
* You have web browser with JavaScript enabled. This project has been tested on Windows, Mac, and Linux.
* You are familiar with general web development techniques and technologies.

## Installing MSCS Hub

To install `MSCSHub`, follow these steps:

```
git clone https://github.com/MSCSHub/MSCSHub.git
cd MSCSHub
npm install
ng serve
```

## Using MSCS Hub

### Local Development
After running `ng serve` you will have a local version of `MSCSHub.com` running on your machine. Open your favorite browser and navigate to [localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) to begin

### Deploying to MSCSHub.com and MSDSHub.com
Use the command `npm run deploy` to run the deployment script that will update both MSCSHub.com and MSDSHub.com. If you want to see more about what's happening behind the scenes when you run this command, take a look at the `scripts` section of `package.json`.

## Documentation
The documentation for MSCSHub.com is hosted at https://mscshub.github.io/MSCSHub-documentation/. This is generated automatically using `compodoc`. It works by automatically parsing the files in the codebase and uses the inline comments to create a fully functional website for documentation.
